## The scope of this project is to familiarize myself with the two stack algorithm and get a better understanding on how computers computes things.

### Summary: Converts from usual mathematical expressions or logical propositions (infix) to Polish notation (Postfix)

All the things it can do in both languages:
1. Convert from infix to postfix.
2. Convert from postfix to infix.
3. Compute value of postfix.
4. Compute value of infix.
